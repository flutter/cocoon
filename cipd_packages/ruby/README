# Ruby at Flutter

The scripts in this folder are used to build and package
ruby as a self contained CIPD package. This package is intended
for flutter/flutter repository testing.

The scripts inside the tools folder are based on the scripts
from https://github.com/stephan-nordnes-eriksen/ruby_ship
with several changes to adapt them to the flutter use cases.


# Updating to new ruby versions.

Update `ruby_metadata.txt` with the major version
and the file name. E.g. `3.1,ruby-3.1.4.tar.gz` to
change the version of ruby to build.

# Installing cocoapods.

The CIPD package will bundle cocoapods with its corresponding
wrapper scripts.

Update `cococapods_version.txt` with the version of cocoapods
to use.
