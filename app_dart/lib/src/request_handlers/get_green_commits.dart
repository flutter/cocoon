/// Returns [List<String>] of the commit shas that had all passing tests.
///
/// A [CommitStatus] that have all passing tests is used to help the release tooling find commits Flutter infrastructure has validated.
/// In order to qualify as a [CommitStatus] that have all passing tests, the rules are:
/// 1. The [Commit] inside [CommitStatus] had all its tests run (at least those that are not in bringup)
/// 2. all the blocking [Task] in [CommitStatus] should pass
/// A [List<String>] of commit shas of the qualified [CommitStatus]s are returned, in the order of [Commit] timestamp, i.e.,
/// A [Commit] with an earlier timestamp will apprear earlier in the result [List<String>], as compared to another [Commit]
/// with a later timestamp.
///
/// Parameters:
///   branch: defaults to the defaults branch for the repository.
///   repo: default: 'flutter'. Name of the repository.
///
