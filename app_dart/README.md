# Dart backend for cocoon

This folder contains a Dart based backend for Cocoon.

## Building and running

### Prerequisites

* Install the Google Cloud Developer Tools Command Line Interface
([`gcloud`](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/quickstarts)). Then initialize it
and authenticate yourself by running:

```sh
gcloud auth login
gcloud init
```
* [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install )
```sh
export PATH="$PATH":"path/to/flutter/bin/"
flutter upgrade
flutter pub get
export PATH="$PATH":"path/to/flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin/"
```

### Running the tests

```sh
pub run test
```

### Running codegen

#### JSON

To update the JSON serialization generated code, run:

```sh
$ pub run build_runner build
```

Any updates should be checked into source control.

#### Protobuf

To update the Protocol Buffer generated code:

1. [Download](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases) and install
   the protocol buffer compiler (`protoc`). Once installed, update your `PATH`
   to include the path to the `protoc` binary.

2. Install the [`protoc_plugin`](https://pub.dev/packages/protoc_plugin) Dart
   package. Once installed, update your `PATH` to include the path to the
   `protoc_plugin/bin` directory (or `$HOME/.pub-cache/bin` if you used
   `pub global activate protoc_plugin`).

3. Run the following command:

   ```sh
   $ protoc \
       --plugin=/path/to/protoc_plugin/bin/ \
       --dart_out=. \
       lib/src/path/to/file.proto
   ```

4. Remove the unused generated files:

   ```sh
   $ find -E . -regex '.*\.(pbenum|pbjson|pbserver)\.dart' -delete
   ```

### Generating cloud datastore indexes

To update the indexes in the App Engine project, run:

```sh
$ gcloud datastore indexes create index.yaml
```

### Updating cloud cron tasks

To update the cron tasks in the App Engine project, run:

```sh
$ gcloud app deploy cron.yaml
```

### Local development

#### Using physical machine

* Setting up the environment

```sh
export COCOON_USE_IN_MEMORY_CACHE=true
```

This environment is needed as you don't have access to the remote redis
instance during local development.

* Starting server

```sh
export COCOON_USE_IN_MEMORY_CACHE=true
dart bin/server.dart
```

If you see Serving requests at 0.0.0.0:8080 the dev server is working.

#### Using Docker

* Running a local development instance

Once you've installed Docker and have the `docker` command-line tool in
your path, then you you can use the following commands to build, run, stop,
and kill a local development instance.

```sh
# Build the docker image
$ docker build -t local .

# Start the local container, clearing the console buffer and tailing the logs
$ container_id="$(docker run -d -p 8080:8080 local)" && \
    clear && \
    printf '\e[3J' && \
    docker logs $container_id -f

# Stop the local Docker container
$ docker container ls|grep local|tr -s ' '|cut -d' ' -f1|xargs docker container stop

# Remove the local Docker image
$ docker images|grep local|tr -s ' '|cut -d' ' -f3|xargs docker rmi -f
```

* ssh into instance

```sh
$ docker exec -it <container name> /bin/bash
```

### Deploying a release to App Engine

#### [Auto-deploy](go/cocoon-cloud-build#auto-deploy)
Cocoon auto deployment has been set up via
[Google Cloud Build](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloud-build/triggers?project=flutter-dashboard)
daily on Workdays.

#### [Manual-deploy(go/cocoon-cloud-build#manual-deploy)

* Using the cloud build

This is easy to deploy if you simply want a new version based on
the latest master commit. Open
[Cloud Build dashboard](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/cloud-build/triggers?project=flutter-dashboard)
and click run in the push-master trigger ([example](https://screenshot.googleplex.com/4DDy4XdVQxMKqCd))

* Using a cocoon checkout
Let `PROJECT_ID` be the Google Cloud Proejct Id and `VERSION` be the version you're deploying to App Engine. Visit
https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine/versions?project=flutter-dashboard
for the list of current versions.

```sh
$ dart dev/deploy.dart --version version-$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) --project flutter-dashboard
```

The deploy script will build the Flutter project and copy it over for deployment.
Then it will use the Google Cloud CLI to deploy the project to AppEngine.

For more options run:

```sh
$ dart dev/deploy.dart --help
```

### Branching support for flutter repo

Add targeted branches in `dev/branches.txt`, based on which cocoon API filters targeted branches and then runs tests on those branches. With tests running against different branches, the frontend then supports listing commits on a specific branch (defaulting to master).

Once the PR has merged, go to https://flutter-dashboard.appspot.com/api/flush-cache?key=flutterBranches to flush the cache and have the latest change take effect. Otherwise, it can take 12 hours for it to propagate. Ensure you are signed into [cocoon dashboard](https://flutter-dashboard.appspot.com) otherwise it will throw a 403.
