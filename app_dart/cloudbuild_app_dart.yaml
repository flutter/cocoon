# Provide instructions for google Cloud Build to auto-build flutter
# dashboard to flutter-dashboard project. Auto-build will be triggered
# by daily schedule on `main` branch. This cloudbuild calls an additional
# cloudbuild configuration responsible for deployment.
#
# This job is for generating the docker image with build provenance,
# and the deployment job uses the generated docker image and deploys it to
# App Engine.

steps:
  # Build dashboard.
  # This step generates the dashboard files using flutter, then moves the
  # generated files into the app_dart folder, where a docker image is then
  # created in the next step.
