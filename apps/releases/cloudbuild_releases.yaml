# Provide instructions for google Cloud Build to auto-build flutter
# Releases bot to flutter-dashboard project. Auto-build will be triggered
# by daily schedule on `main` branch. This cloudbuild calls an additional
# cloudbuild configuration responsible for deployment.
#
# This job is for generating the docker image with build provenance,
# and the deployment job uses the generated docker image and deploys it to
# App Engine.

steps:
  # Build docker image
  - name: 'us-docker.pkg.dev/cloud-builders/ga/v1/docker'
    args: ['build', '-t', 'us-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/appengine/releases.version-$SHORT_SHA', 'releases']

  # Trigger the cloud build that deploys the docker image
  - name: gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud
    entrypoint: '/bin/bash'
    args:
      - '-c'
      - |-
        gcloud builds submit \
          --config releases/cloudbuild_releases_deploy.yaml \
