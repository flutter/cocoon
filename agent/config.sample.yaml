# Sample agent configuration, with explanations for every parameter.

# The URL of the Cocoon server.
#
# To make test an agent with your dev server, set this to http://localhost:8080.
#
# For production server _always_ use HTTPS.
base_cocoon_url: https://flutter-dashboard.appspot.com

# The ID of this agent.
agent_id: agent-with-ios-devices-#5

# Agent attached this token to its HTTP requests to authenticate itself.
#
# To acquire a token, open `base_cocoon_url` in Chrome, open Chrome Dev Tools,
# select Console tab, then:
#
# If `agent_id` is not yet registered with Cocoon, enter:
#
# cocoon.createAgent(['-a', 'AGENT_ID', '-c', 'CAPABILITY#1', ...])
#
# Replace AGENT_ID with the value of `agent_id`, and enter the capabilities
# offered by the agent. The `auth_token` value will be printed to the console.
#
# If `agent_id` is already registered with Cocoon, enter:
#
# cocoon.authAgent(['-a', 'AGENT_ID'])
#
# Replace AGENT_ID with the value of `agent_id`.
auth_token: blahblahblah

# Contact sethladd@google.com, yjbanov@google.com or devoncarew@google.com to
# get a Firebase token. Token "test" will cause the agent to skip uploading
# results to Firebase.
firebase_flutter_dashboard_token: test

# The device operating system. Possible values: android, ios.
device_os: android
