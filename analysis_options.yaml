# Specify analysis options for all of flutter/cocoon
#
# Until there are meta linter rules, each desired lint must be explicitly enabled.
# See: https://github.com/dart-lang/linter/issues/288

# For a list of lints, see: http://dart-lang.github.io/linter/lints/
# See the configuration guide for more

# There are other similar analysis options files in the flutter repos,
# which should be kept in sync with this file:
#
#   - analysis_options.yaml (this file)
#   - packages/flutter/lib/analysis_options_user.yaml
#   - https://github.com/flutter/plugins/blob/master/analysis_options.yaml
#   - https://github.com/flutter/engine/blob/master/analysis_options.yaml
#
# This file contains the analysis options used by Flutter tools, such as IntelliJ,
# Android Studio, and the `flutter analyze` command.
