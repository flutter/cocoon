/// Storage agnostic data models that originate from the Cocoon backend.
///
/// This library contains models that are are deserialized from calls to
/// `CocoonService`. While they _may_ be created ephemerally within the app
/// itself, models that are UI-specific should live elsewhere (closer to the
/// widgets they define).
///
/// Every model in this library must:
/// 1. Be deeply [immutable], using unmodifiable collections where appropriate
/// 2. Not expose what backend store the model originates from (no primary keys)
/// 3. Use [JsonSerializable] to define `.fromJson` and `.toJson` functions
/// 4. Not depend on the Flutter SDK
///
/// To regenerate the JSON serialization code after making model changes:
/// ```sh
/// cd dashboard
/// dart run build_runner build
/// ```
///
/// @docImport 'package:json_annotation/json_annotation.dart';
/// @docImport 'package:meta/meta.dart';
