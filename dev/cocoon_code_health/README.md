# Cocoon Code Health

Tests and tools that try to keep the `flutter/cocoon` repo healthy.

Note that this package currently has some overlap in responsibility (but not
precise implementation) with the root [`analyze`](../../analyze/) package, but
new functionality should be added here (and migrated from `analyze`).
