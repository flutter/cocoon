/// Generates a [Task] for use in a test fixture with as few fields as possible.
///
/// Based on the [status], fields are filled in automatically in order to make
/// the returned [Task] sementically valid. For example, a _started_ task (is
/// neither new or skipped) includes a [startTime] and a [buildNumberList],
/// while a _completed_ task (is not in progress) also includes a [finishTime].
///
/// ## Default Timestamps
///
/// If times are omitted, and filled in with defaults, they are created
/// relative to [nowTime]:
/// - [createTime] is 52 minutes before [nowTime];
/// - [startTime] is 50 minutes before [nowTime];
/// - [finishTime] is 10 minutes before [nowTime].
///
/// [nowTime], if omitted, defaults to `DateTime.utc(2020, 9, 1, 12, 30)`,
/// or [utc$2020_9_1_12_30].
///
/// ## Queued Tasks versus Running Tasks
///
/// To simulate a task that has been _scheduled_, so is "In Progress", but does
/// not have any active builds ( is queued), explicitly set [buildNumberList]
/// to an empty string (`''`), or a string containing less build numbers than
/// the amount of attempts:
/// ```dart
/// // .buildNumberList automatically has 1 build
/// generateTaskForTest(status: TaskBox.statusInProgress)
///
/// // .buildNumberList automatically has 3 builds
/// generateTaskForTest(status: TaskBox.statusInProgress, attempts: 3);
///
/// // .buildNumberList is explicitly empty, indicating a queued build.
/// generateTaskForTest(status: TaskBox.statusInProgress, buildNumberList: '')
///
/// // .buildNumberList has less builds than attempts.
/// generateTaskForTest(status: TaskBox.statusInProgress, buildNumberList: '1,2', attempts: 3)
/// ```
