# Product Definition - Flutter Dashboard

## Initial Concept
The Flutter dashboard.

## Target Audience
The primary users of the Flutter Dashboard are **Flutter framework developers and contributors**. The tool is designed to provide them with the necessary visibility into the health and stability of the Flutter project.

## Core Goals
The main objective of the dashboard is **monitoring the health and status of the Flutter build tree**. It serves as a central hub for observing the continuous integration process and ensuring that changes to the framework do not introduce regressions.

## Key Features
*   **Commit Status Grid:** A comprehensive grid view displaying the status of various tasks across different commits, allowing for quick identification of regressions or flaky tests.
*   **Real-time Updates:** The dashboard provides real-time updates of build statuses, ensuring that developers have the most current information regarding the tree health.
*   **Task Summary Popovers:** Clicking on a task in the grid opens a summary popover, providing immediate access to task details and direct links to full logs for deeper investigation.
*   **Actionable UI:** Integration with backend services to allow authorized users to trigger re-runs of failed tasks directly from the dashboard interface.

## Visual Aesthetic & UX
The dashboard adheres to **Material Design** principles, providing a standard, familiar, and polished Flutter user experience. The interface focuses on clarity and accessibility, ensuring that critical build information is easy to find and interpret.
