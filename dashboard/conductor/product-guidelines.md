# Product Guidelines - Flutter Dashboard

## Communication & Prose
*   **Style:** Technical and precise. Documentation and user-facing text should prioritize accuracy, clarity, and brevity to ensure information is conveyed efficiently to a technical audience.
*   **Tone:** Professional and objective. Focus on facts and actionable information.

## Visual Identity & UX
*   **Design System:** Standard Material Design 3. The dashboard will strictly follow the latest Material Design specifications to ensure a modern, consistent, and recognizable Flutter user experience.
*   **Layout:** Prioritize clarity and logical flow. Use Material components (Scaffolds, Cards, Buttons, etc.) to structure information predictably.

## Accessibility (a11y)
*   **Compliance:** Strict adherence to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.
*   **Implementation:** All UI elements must have appropriate semantic labels, maintain high contrast ratios, and provide full support for screen readers.
*   **Focus Management:** Ensure a logical focus order for keyboard navigation across all interactive elements.

## Error Handling & Feedback
*   **Clarity:** Errors must be explicit and actionable. Avoid vague error messages.
*   **Guidance:** Provide users with clear instructions on how to resolve the issue (e.g., "Authentication failed, please sign in again").
*   **Visibility:** Use appropriate UI patterns (dialogs for critical errors, snackbars for transient info) to ensure feedback is noticed without being unnecessarily disruptive.
